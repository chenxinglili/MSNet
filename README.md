# MSNet
Multi-scale speech enhancement

The speech stored in this git is enhanced by our MSNet. We evaluate the performance on two datasets. 
(1) An open-source dataset [1]. 
(2) A large-scale dataset (Designed and generated by ourselves). 

In this Git, enhanced speech are models are uploaded. 
In the folder appendix, more explanations about model structure and hyper-parameters will be added.
